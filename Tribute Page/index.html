                    Linus Sebastian is Canadian youtuber and founder/CEO of Linus Media Group. He is best known for making and 
                    hosting YouTube videos covering technology and personal computing. Linus has an engaging presenting style

                    Linus got his start in online video making in now defunct Canadian computer retailer where he was asked to 
                    make YouTube videos for product demonstration and â€¦ purposes in 2007. Two YouTube channels were created for 
                    this purpose NCIX Tech Tips and Linus Tech Tips. Linus Tech Tips was initially cheaper offshoot of the NCIX 
                    channel, to allow for lower production values without impacting the NCIX brand. After some time, Linus parted 
                    ways with NCIX and spurred up his own company Linus Media Group to run the YouTube channel carrying his name
                    that he had purchased form NCIX. Initially Linus Media group or LMG was run out of Linus's garage but quickly
                    grew due to his recognition from NCIX Tech Tips. LMG now employs over eighty people and is growing rapidly. 
                    LMGs flagship YouTube channel is still Linus Tech Tips, and it has over 14 million subscribers and over 6 
                    billion total views. Linus Tech Tips focuses on entertaining educational content about latest technology, 
                    personal computing, and gaming. LMG also has five other technology focused YouTube channels and one channel
                    depicting LMG employees' fun activities.

                    Linus has also founded two other companies Floatplane Media inc. and Creator Warehouse inc. Floatplane media
                    was created to offers a paid video streaming service for Linus Media Group as well as for other content
                    creators. Whereas Creator Warehouse is an online retailer making and selling merchandise for fans of 
                    Linus Media Groups. Creator Warehouse is set to offer this service to other creators as well in the future.
                    Linus is currently setting up a fourth company that is going to focus on independent product testing.

                    As for me. I started watching Linus's videos in the early days when he still worked at NCIX and have 
                    followed him closely ever since. Linus sparked a particular interest in me for technology and especially
                    for personal computers. I had always been interested in new tech but watching him showcasing all kinds of
                    cool stuff kicked up the interest a whole lot. Computers had been a fun toy/tool for me, but Linus got 
                    me interested in them in a totally different way.  First, I build my own gaming computer and was succeed 
                    in the amazing world of online gaming. But then Linus's videos got me learning about overclocking and 
                    other optimizations to make my computer faster. Not long after that the technical things about computers 
                    felt even more interesting than the games, I initially build my computer for. Ever since that I have been 
                    totally hooked. In addition to the hardware, I have been lately more and more interested in software and 
                    coding. And after realizing that my physics studies didn't interest me nearly as much as the coding the 
                    calculations required, I switch from physics major to computer major and I could not be happier. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you, Linus.
